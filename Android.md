Build libraries for Android using CMake and NDK. Use the following command to build the libraries:
- Minimum API level: 34
- NDK PATH: /home/djshaji/Downloads/ndk-29/android-ndk-r29
- Build both static and shared libraries
- Build for following ABIs: arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, x86, x86_64
- Use CMake toolchain file provided by NDK
- Set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to Release
- Output shared libraries to a directory named "jniLibs" in the current working directory
- Organize output by ABI, e.g., jniLibs/arm64-v8a/libmp3lame.so
- Output static libraries to a directory named "libs" in the current working directory
- Organize output by ABI, e.g., libs/arm64-v8a/libmp3lame.a
